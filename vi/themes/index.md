## About Ghost themes

Ghost themes are intended to be simple to build and maintain. They advocate strong separation between templates (the HTML) and any business logic (JavaScript). Handlebars is (almost) logicless and enforces this separation, providing the helper mechanism so that business logic for displaying content remains separate and self-contained. This separation lends itself towards easier collaboration between designers and developers when building themes.

Handlebars templates are hierarchical (one template can extend another template) and also support partial templates. Ghost uses these features to reduce code duplication and keep individual templates focused on doing a single job, and doing it well. A well structured theme will be easy to maintain and keeping components separated makes them easier to reuse between themes.

We really hope you'll enjoy our approach to theming.

## Creating Your Own Theme <a id="create-your-own"></a>

Create your own Ghost theme by either copying Casper, or adding a new folder to the <code class="path">content/themes</code> directory with the name of your theme, E.g. my-theme (names should be lowercase, and contain letters, numbers and hyphens only). Then add two empty files to your new theme folder: index.hbs and post.hbs. It won't display anything, but this is effectively a valid theme.

### The post list

<code class="path">index.hbs</code> gets handed an object called `posts` which can be used with the foreach helper to output each post. E.g.

```
{{#foreach posts}}
// here we are in the context of a single post
// whatever you put here gets run for each post in posts
{{/foreach}}
```

See the section on the [`{{#foreach}}`](#foreach-helper) helper for more details.

#### Pagination

See the section on the [`{{pagination}}`](#pagination-helper) helper.

### Outputting individual posts

Once you are in the context of a single post, either by looping through the posts list with `foreach` or inside of <code class="path">post.hbs</code> you have access to the properties of a post.

For the time being, these are:

*   id – *post id*
*   title – *post title*
*   url – *the relative URL for a post*
*   content – *post HTML*
*   published_at – *date the post was published*
*   author – *full details of the post author* (see below for more details)

Each of these properties can be output using the standard handlebars expression, e.g. `{{title}}`.

<div class="note">
  <p>
    <strong>Notes:</strong> <ul>
      <li>
        the content property is overridden and output by the <code>{{content}}</code> helper which ensures the HTML is output safely & correctly. See the section on the <a href="#content-helper"><code>{{content}}</code> helper</a> for more info.
      </li>
      <li>
        the url property provided by the <code>{{url}}</code> helper. See the section on the <a href="#url-helper"><code>{{url}}</code> helper</a> for more info.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </p>
</div>

#### Post author

When inside the context of a single post, the following author data is available:

*   `{{author.name}}` – the name of the author
*   `{{author.bio}}` – the author's bio
*   `{{author.website}}` – the author's website
*   `{{author.image}}` – the author's profile image
*   `{{author.cover}}` – the author's cover image

You can use just`{{author}}` to output the author's name with a link to their author page.

This can also be done by using a block expression:

```
{{#author}}
    <a href="{{url}}">{{name}}</a>
{{/author}}
```

#### Post Tags

When inside the context of a single post, the following tag data is available

*   `{{tag.name}}` – the name of the tag

You can use `{{tags}}` to output a customisable list of tags, this can also be done by using a block expression:

```
<ul>
    {{#foreach tags}}
        <li>{{name}}</li>
    {{/foreach}}
</ul>
```

See the section on the [`{{tags}}`](#tags-helper) helper for details of the options.

### Global Settings

Ghost themes have access to a number of global settings via the `@blog` global data accessor.

*   `{{@blog.url}}` – the url specified for this env in <code class="path">config.js</code>
*   `{{@blog.title}}` – the blog title from the settings page
*   `{{@blog.description}}` – the blog description from the settings page
*   `{{@blog.logo}}` – the blog logo from the settings page
