The key material in a symmetric encryption key never leaves KMS unencrypted. You can use a symmetric encryption KMS key to encrypt and decrypt data up to 4,096 bytes, but they are typically used to generate data keys and data keys pairs.

However, you can't create multi-Region keys in a custom key store.</p> <p>This operation supports <i>multi-Region keys</i>, an KMS feature that lets you create multiple interoperable KMS keys in different Amazon Web Services Regions. Because these KMS keys have the same key ID, key material, and other metadata, you can use them interchangeably to encrypt data in one Amazon Web Services Region and decrypt it in a different Amazon Web Services Region without re-encrypting the data or making a cross-Region call. For more information about multi-Region keys, see <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/multi-region-keys-overview.html\">Multi-Region keys in KMS</a> in the <i>Key Management Service Developer Guide</i>.</p> <p> </p> </dd> <dd> <p>To import your own key material into a KMS key, begin by creating a KMS key with no key material. To do this, use the <code>Origin</code> parameter of <code>CreateKey</code> with a value of <code>EXTERNAL</code>.

KMS can get this information from metadata that it adds to the symmetric ciphertext blob. This feature adds durability to your implementation by ensuring that authorized users can decrypt ciphertext decades after it was encrypted, even if they've lost track of the key ID. However, specifying the KMS key is always recommended as a best practice. When you use the <code>KeyId</code> parameter to specify a KMS key, KMS only uses the KMS key you specify. If the ciphertext was encrypted under a different KMS key, the <code>Decrypt</code> operation fails. This practice ensures that you use the KMS key that you intend.</p> <p>Whenever possible, use key policies to give users permission to call the <code>Decrypt</code> operation on a particular KMS key, instead of using IAM policies. Otherwise, you might create an IAM policy that gives the user <code>Decrypt</code> permission on all KMS keys. This user could decrypt ciphertext that was encrypted by KMS keys in other accounts if the key policy for the cross-account KMS key permits it. If you must use an IAM policy for <code>Decrypt</code> permissions, limit the user to particular KMS keys or particular trusted accounts.

To verify the updated property values, use the <a>DescribeCustomKeyStores</a> operation.</p> <p> This operation is part of the custom key stores feature in KMS, which combines the convenience and extensive integration of KMS with the isolation and control of a key store that you own and manage.</p> <important> <p>When updating the properties of an external key store, verify that the updated settings connect your key store, via the external key store proxy, to the same external key manager as the previous settings, or to a backup or snapshot of the external key manager with the same cryptographic keys. If the updated connection settings fail, you can fix them and retry, although an extended delay might disrupt Amazon Web Services services. However, if KMS permanently loses its access to cryptographic keys, ciphertext encrypted under those keys is unrecoverable.</p> </important> <note> <p>For external key stores:</p> <p>Some external key managers provide a simpler method for updating an external key store. For details, see your external key manager documentation.</p> <p>When updating an external key store in the KMS console, you can upload a JSON-based proxy configuration file with the desired values. You cannot upload the proxy configuration file to the <code>UpdateCustomKeyStore</code> operation. However, you can use the file to help you determine the correct values for the <code>UpdateCustomKeyStore</code> parameters.</p> </note> <p>For an CloudHSM key store, you can use this operation to change the custom key store friendly name (<code>NewCustomKeyStoreName</code>), to tell KMS about a change to the <code>kmsuser</code> crypto user password (<code>KeyStorePassword</code>), or to associate the custom key store with a different, but related, CloudHSM cluster (<code>CloudHsmClusterId</code>). To update any property of an CloudHSM key store, the <code>ConnectionState</code> of the CloudHSM key store must be <code>DISCONNECTED</code>. </p> <p>For an external key store, you can use this operation to change the custom key store friendly name (<code>NewCustomKeyStoreName</code>), or to tell KMS about a change to the external key store proxy authentication credentials (<code>XksProxyAuthenticationCredential</code>), connection method (<code>XksProxyConnectivity</code>), external proxy endpoint (<code>XksProxyUriEndpoint</code>) and path (<code>XksProxyUriPath</code>). For external key stores with an <code>XksProxyConnectivity</code> of <code>VPC_ENDPOINT_SERVICE</code>, you can also update the Amazon VPC endpoint service name (<code>XksProxyVpcEndpointServiceName</code>). To update most properties of an external key store, the <code>ConnectionState</code> of the external key store must be <code>DISCONNECTED</code>. However, you can update the <code>CustomKeyStoreName</code>, <code>XksProxyAuthenticationCredential</code>, and <code>XksProxyUriPath</code> of an external key store when it is in the CONNECTED or DISCONNECTED state. </p> <p>If your update requires a <code>DISCONNECTED</code> state, before using <code>UpdateCustomKeyStore</code>, use the <a>DisconnectCustomKeyStore</a> operation to disconnect the custom key store. After the <code>UpdateCustomKeyStore</code> operation completes, use the <a>ConnectCustomKeyStore</a> to reconnect the custom key store. To find the <code>ConnectionState</code> of the custom key store, use the <a>DescribeCustomKeyStores</a> operation. </p> <p> </p> <p>Before updating the custom key store, verify that the new values allow KMS to connect the custom key store to its backing key store. For example, before you change the <code>XksProxyUriPath</code> value, verify that the external key store proxy is reachable at the new path.</p> <p>If the operation succeeds, it returns a JSON object with no properties.</p> <p> <b>Cross-account use</b>: No. You cannot perform this operation on a custom key store in a different Amazon Web Services account.</p> <p> <b>Required permissions</b>: <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/kms-api-permissions-reference.html\">kms:UpdateCustomKeyStore</a> (IAM policy)</p> <p> <b>Related operations:</b> </p> <ul> <li> <p> <a>ConnectCustomKeyStore</a> </p> </li> <li> <p> <a>CreateCustomKeyStore</a> </p> </li> <li> <p> <a>DeleteCustomKeyStore</a> </p> </li> <li> <p> <a>DescribeCustomKeyStores</a> </p> </li> <li> <p> <a>DisconnectCustomKeyStore</a> </p> </li> </ul> <p> <b>Eventual consistency</b>: The KMS API follows an eventual consistency model.

  "documentation":"<fullname>Key Management Service</fullname> <p>Key Management Service (KMS) is an encryption and key management web service. This guide describes the KMS operations that you can call programmatically. For general information about KMS, see the <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/\"> <i>Key Management Service Developer Guide</i> </a>.</p> <note> <p>KMS has replaced the term <i>customer master key (CMK)</i> with <i>Key Management Service key</i> and <i>KMS key</i>. The concept has not changed. To prevent breaking changes, KMS is keeping some variations of this term.</p> <p>Amazon Web Services provides SDKs that consist of libraries and sample code for various programming languages and platforms (Java, Rust, Python, Ruby, .Net, macOS, Android, etc.). The SDKs provide a convenient way to create programmatic access to KMS and other Amazon Web Services services. For example, the SDKs take care of tasks such as signing requests (see below), managing errors, and retrying requests automatically. For more information about the Amazon Web Services SDKs, including how to download and install them, see <a href=\"http://aws.amazon.com/tools/\">Tools for Amazon Web Services</a>.</p> </note> <p>We recommend that you use the Amazon Web Services SDKs to make programmatic API calls to KMS.</p> <p>If you need to use FIPS 140-2 validated cryptographic modules when communicating with Amazon Web Services, use one of the FIPS endpoints in your preferred Amazon Web Services Region. If you need communicate over IPv6, use the dual-stack endpoint in your preferred Amazon Web Services Region. For more information see <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/kms.html#kms_region\">Service endpoints</a> in the Key Management Service topic of the <i>Amazon Web Services General Reference</i> and <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/latest/developerguide/ipv6-kms.html\">Dual-stack endpoint support</a> in the KMS Developer Guide.</p> <p>All KMS API calls must be signed and be transmitted using Transport Layer Security (TLS). KMS recommends you always use the latest supported TLS version. Clients must also support cipher suites with Perfect Forward Secrecy (PFS) such as Ephemeral Diffie-Hellman (DHE) or Elliptic Curve Ephemeral Diffie-Hellman (ECDHE). Most modern systems such as Java 7 and later support these modes.</p> <p> <b>Signing Requests</b> </p> <p>Requests must be signed using an access key ID and a secret access key. We strongly recommend that you do not use your Amazon Web Services account root access key ID and secret access key for everyday work. You can use the access key ID and secret access key for an IAM user or you can use the Security Token Service (STS) to generate temporary security credentials and use those to sign requests. </p> <p>All KMS requests must be signed with <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/signature-version-4.html\">Signature Version 4</a>.</p> <p> <b>Logging API Requests</b> </p> <p>KMS supports CloudTrail, a service that logs Amazon Web Services API calls and related events for your Amazon Web Services account and delivers them to an Amazon S3 bucket that you specify. By using the information collected by CloudTrail, you can determine what requests were made to KMS, who made the request, when it was made, and so on. To learn more about CloudTrail, including how to turn it on and find your log files, see the <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/awscloudtrail/latest/userguide/\">CloudTrail User Guide</a>.</p> <p> <b>Additional Resources</b> </p> <p>For more information about credentials and request signing, see the following:</p> <ul> <li> <p> <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws-security-credentials.html\">Amazon Web Services Security Credentials</a> - This topic provides general information about the types of credentials used to access Amazon Web Services.</p> </li> <li> <p> <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_temp.html\">Temporary Security Credentials</a> - This section of the <i>IAM User Guide</i> describes how to create and use temporary security credentials.</p> </li> <li> <p> <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/signature-version-4.html\">Signature Version 4 Signing Process</a> - This set of topics walks you through the process of signing a request using an access key ID and a secret access key.</p> </li> </ul> <p> <b>Commonly Used API Operations</b> </p> <p>Of the API operations discussed in this guide, the following will prove the most useful for most applications.
