      "documentation":"<p>Exports a key from Amazon Web Services Payment Cryptography.</p> <p>Amazon Web Services Payment Cryptography simplifies key exchange by replacing the existing paper-based approach with a modern electronic approach. With <code>ExportKey</code> you can export symmetric keys using either symmetric and asymmetric key exchange mechanisms. Using this operation, you can share your Amazon Web Services Payment Cryptography generated keys with other service partners to perform cryptographic operations outside of Amazon Web Services Payment Cryptography </p> <p>For symmetric key exchange, Amazon Web Services Payment Cryptography uses the ANSI X9 TR-31 norm in accordance with PCI PIN guidelines. And for asymmetric key exchange, Amazon Web Services Payment Cryptography supports ANSI X9 TR-34 norm, RSA unwrap, and ECDH (Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman) key exchange mechanisms. Asymmetric key exchange methods are typically used to establish bi-directional trust between the two parties exhanging keys and are used for initial key exchange such as Key Encryption Key (KEK). After which you can export working keys using symmetric method to perform various cryptographic operations within Amazon Web Services Payment Cryptography.</p> <p>PCI requires specific minimum key strength of wrapping keys used to protect the keys being exchanged electronically. These requirements can change when PCI standards are revised. The rules specify that wrapping keys used for transport must be at least as strong as the key being protected. For more information on recommended key strength of wrapping keys and key exchange mechanism, see <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/payment-cryptography/latest/userguide/keys-importexport.html\">Importing and exporting keys</a> in the <i>Amazon Web Services Payment Cryptography User Guide</i>.</p> <p>You can also use <code>ExportKey</code> functionality to generate and export an IPEK (Initial Pin Encryption Key) from Amazon Web Services Payment Cryptography using either TR-31 or TR-34 export key exchange. IPEK is generated from BDK (Base Derivation Key) and <code>ExportDukptInitialKey</code> attribute KSN (<code>KeySerialNumber</code>). The generated IPEK does not persist within Amazon Web Services Payment Cryptography and has to be re-generated each time during export.</p> <p>For key exchange using TR-31 or TR-34 key blocks, you can also export optional blocks within the key block header which contain additional attribute information about the key. The <code>KeyVersion</code> within <code>KeyBlockHeaders</code> indicates the version of the key within the key block. Furthermore, <code>KeyExportability</code> within <code>KeyBlockHeaders</code> can be used to further restrict exportability of the key after export from Amazon Web Services Payment Cryptography.</p> <p>The <code>OptionalBlocks</code> contain the additional data related to the key. For information on data type that can be included within optional blocks, refer to <a href=\"https://webstore.ansi.org/standards/ascx9/ansix91432022\">ASC X9.143-2022</a>.</p> <note> <p>Data included in key block headers is signed but transmitted in clear text.

Refer to ASC X9.143-2022 standard for information on allowed data type.</p> </note> <p> <b>To export initial keys (KEK) or IPEK using TR-34</b> </p> <p>Using this operation, you can export initial key using TR-34 asymmetric key exchange. You can only export KEK generated within Amazon Web Services Payment Cryptography. In TR-34 terminology, the sending party of the key is called Key Distribution Host (KDH) and the receiving party of the key is called Key Receiving Device (KRD). During key export process, KDH is Amazon Web Services Payment Cryptography which initiates key export and KRD is the user receiving the key.</p> <p>To initiate TR-34 key export, the KRD must obtain an export token by calling <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/payment-cryptography/latest/APIReference/API_GetParametersForExport.html\">GetParametersForExport</a>. This operation also generates a key pair for the purpose of key export, signs the key and returns back the signing public key certificate (also known as KDH signing certificate) and root certificate chain. The KDH uses the private key to sign the the export payload and the signing public key certificate is provided to KRD to verify the signature. The KRD can import the root certificate into its Hardware Security Module (HSM), as required. The export token and the associated KDH signing certificate expires after 30 days. </p> <p>Next the KRD generates a key pair for the the purpose of encrypting the KDH key and provides the public key cerificate (also known as KRD wrapping certificate) back to KDH. The KRD will also import the root cerificate chain into Amazon Web Services Payment Cryptography by calling <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/payment-cryptography/latest/APIReference/API_ImportKey.html\">ImportKey</a> for <code>RootCertificatePublicKey</code>. The KDH, Amazon Web Services Payment Cryptography, will use the KRD wrapping cerificate to encrypt (wrap) the key under export and signs it with signing private key to generate a TR-34 WrappedKeyBlock. For more information on TR-34 key export, see section <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/payment-cryptography/latest/userguide/keys-export.html\">Exporting symmetric keys</a> in the <i>Amazon Web Services Payment Cryptography User Guide</i>. </p> <p>Set the following parameters:</p> <ul> <li> <p> <code>ExportAttributes</code>: Specify export attributes in case of IPEK export.

With <code>ImportKey</code> you can import symmetric keys using either symmetric and asymmetric key exchange mechanisms.</p> <p>For symmetric key exchange, Amazon Web Services Payment Cryptography uses the ANSI X9 TR-31 norm in accordance with PCI PIN guidelines. And for asymmetric key exchange, Amazon Web Services Payment Cryptography supports ANSI X9 TR-34 norm, RSA unwrap, and ECDH (Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman) key exchange mechanisms. Asymmetric key exchange methods are typically used to establish bi-directional trust between the two parties exhanging keys and are used for initial key exchange such as Key Encryption Key (KEK) or Zone Master Key (ZMK). After which you can import working keys using symmetric method to perform various cryptographic operations within Amazon Web Services Payment Cryptography.</p> <p>PCI requires specific minimum key strength of wrapping keys used to protect the keys being exchanged electronically. These requirements can change when PCI standards are revised. The rules specify that wrapping keys used for transport must be at least as strong as the key being protected. For more information on recommended key strength of wrapping keys and key exchange mechanism, see <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/payment-cryptography/latest/userguide/keys-importexport.html\">Importing and exporting keys</a> in the <i>Amazon Web Services Payment Cryptography User Guide</i>.</p> <p>You can also import a <i>root public key certificate</i>, used to sign other public key certificates, or a <i>trusted public key certificate</i> under an already established root public key certificate.</p> <p> <b>To import a public root key certificate</b> </p> <p>Using this operation, you can import the public component (in PEM cerificate format) of your private root key. You can use the imported public root key certificate for digital signatures, for example signing wrapping key or signing key in TR-34, within your Amazon Web Services Payment Cryptography account.</p> <p>Set the following parameters:</p> <ul> <li> <p> <code>KeyMaterial</code>: <code>RootCertificatePublicKey</code> </p> </li> <li> <p> <code>KeyClass</code>: <code>PUBLIC_KEY</code> </p> </li> <li> <p> <code>KeyModesOfUse</code>: <code>Verify</code> </p> </li> <li> <p> <code>KeyUsage</code>: <code>TR31_S0_ASYMMETRIC_KEY_FOR_DIGITAL_SIGNATURE</code> </p> </li> <li> <p> <code>PublicKeyCertificate</code>: The public key certificate in PEM format (base64 encoded) of the private root key under import.</p> </li> </ul> <p> <b>To import a trusted public key certificate</b> </p> <p>The root public key certificate must be in place and operational before you import a trusted public key certificate.

In TR-34 terminology, the sending party of the key is called Key Distribution Host (KDH) and the receiving party of the key is called Key Receiving Device (KRD). During the key import process, KDH is the user who initiates the key import and KRD is Amazon Web Services Payment Cryptography who receives the key.</p> <p>To initiate TR-34 key import, the KDH must obtain an import token by calling <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/payment-cryptography/latest/APIReference/API_GetParametersForImport.html\">GetParametersForImport</a>. This operation generates an encryption keypair for the purpose of key import, signs the key and returns back the wrapping key certificate (also known as KRD wrapping certificate) and the root certificate chain. The KDH must trust and install the KRD wrapping certificate on its HSM and use it to encrypt (wrap) the KDH key during TR-34 WrappedKeyBlock generation. The import token and associated KRD wrapping certificate expires after 30 days.</p> <p>Next the KDH generates a key pair for the purpose of signing the encrypted KDH key and provides the public certificate of the signing key to Amazon Web Services Payment Cryptography. The KDH will also need to import the root certificate chain of the KDH signing certificate by calling <code>ImportKey</code> for <code>RootCertificatePublicKey</code>.

This operation also generates an encryption keypair for the purpose of key import, signs the key and returns back the wrapping key certificate in PEM format (base64 encoded) and its root certificate chain. The import token and associated KRD wrapping certificate expires after 30 days. </p> <p>You must trust and install the wrapping certificate and its certificate chain on the sending HSM and use it to wrap the key under export for WrappedKeyCryptogram generation. Next call <code>ImportKey</code> with <code>KeyMaterial</code> set to <code>KEY_CRYPTOGRAM</code> and provide the <code>ImportToken</code> and <code>KeyAttributes</code> for the key under import.</p> <p> <b>To import working keys using TR-31</b> </p> <p>Amazon Web Services Payment Cryptography uses TR-31 symmetric key exchange norm to import working keys. A KEK must be established within Amazon Web Services Payment Cryptography by using TR-34 key import or by using <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/payment-cryptography/latest/APIReference/API_CreateKey.html\">CreateKey</a>. To initiate a TR-31 key import, set the following parameters:</p> <ul> <li> <p> <code>KeyMaterial</code>: Use <code>Tr31KeyBlock</code> parameters.</p> </li> <li> <p> <code>WrappedKeyBlock</code>: The TR-31 wrapped key material. It contains the key under import, encrypted using KEK.

In Amazon Web Services Payment Cryptography, you can do this by calling <code>CreateKey</code> and then <code>GetPublicKeyCertificate</code> to retrieve its public key certificate. Next, you can then generate a TR-31 WrappedKeyBlock using your own ECC key pair, the public certificate of the service's ECC key pair, and the key derivation parameters including key derivation function, hash algorithm, derivation data, and key algorithm. If you have not already done so, you must import the CA chain that issued the receiving public key certificate by calling <code>ImportKey</code> with input <code>RootCertificatePublicKey</code> for root CA or <code>TrustedPublicKey</code> for intermediate CA. To complete the TR-31 key import, you can use the following parameters. It is important that the ECDH key derivation parameters you use should match those used during import to derive the same shared wrapping key within Amazon Web Services Payment Cryptography.</p> <ul> <li> <p> <code>KeyMaterial</code>: Use <code>DiffieHellmanTr31KeyBlock</code> parameters.</p> </li> <li> <p> <code>PrivateKeyIdentifier</code>: The <code>KeyArn</code> of the ECC key pair created within Amazon Web Services Payment Cryptography to derive a shared KEK.</p> </li> <li> <p> <code>PublicKeyCertificate</code>: The public key certificate of the receiving ECC key pair in PEM format (base64 encoded) to derive a shared KEK.</p> </li> <li> <p> <code>CertificateAuthorityPublicKeyIdentifier</code>: The <code>keyARN</code> of the CA that signed the public key certificate of the receiving ECC key pair.</p> </li> </ul> <p> <b>Cross-account use:</b> This operation can't be used across different Amazon Web Services accounts.</p> <p> <b>Related operations:</b> </p> <ul> <li> <p> <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/payment-cryptography/latest/APIReference/API_ExportKey.html\">ExportKey</a> </p> </li> <li> <p> <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/payment-cryptography/latest/APIReference/API_GetParametersForImport.html\">GetParametersForImport</a> </p> </li> </ul>"
