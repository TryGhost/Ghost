If you make changes to an image, deregister the previous image and register the new image.</p> <p> <b>Register a snapshot of a root device volume</b> </p> <p>You can use <code>RegisterImage</code> to create an Amazon EBS-backed Linux AMI from a snapshot of a root device volume. You specify the snapshot using a block device mapping. You can't set the encryption state of the volume using the block device mapping. If the snapshot is encrypted, or encryption by default is enabled, the root volume of an instance launched from the AMI is encrypted.</p> <p>For more information, see <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/creating-an-ami-ebs.html#creating-launching-ami-from-snapshot\">Create an AMI from a snapshot</a> and <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/AMIEncryption.html\">Use encryption with EBS-backed AMIs</a> in the <i>Amazon EC2 User Guide</i>.</p> <p> <b>Amazon Web Services Marketplace product codes</b> </p> <p>If any snapshots have Amazon Web Services Marketplace product codes, they are copied to the new AMI.</p> <p>In most cases, AMIs for Windows, RedHat, SUSE, and SQL Server require correct licensing information to be present on the AMI. For more information, see <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ami-billing-info.html\">Understand AMI billing information</a> in the <i>Amazon EC2 User Guide</i>. When creating an AMI from a snapshot, the <code>RegisterImage</code> operation derives the correct billing information from the snapshot's metadata, but this requires the appropriate metadata to be present. To verify if the correct billing information was applied, check the <code>PlatformDetails</code> field on the new AMI. If the field is empty or doesn't match the expected operating system code (for example, Windows, RedHat, SUSE, or SQL), the AMI creation was unsuccessful, and you should discard the AMI and instead create the AMI from an instance. For more information, see <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/creating-an-ami-ebs.html#how-to-create-ebs-ami\">Create an AMI from an instance </a> in the <i>Amazon EC2 User Guide</i>.</p> <p>If you purchase a Reserved Instance to apply to an On-Demand Instance that was launched from an AMI with a billing product code, make sure that the Reserved Instance has the matching billing product code. If you purchase a Reserved Instance without the matching billing product code, the Reserved Instance is not applied to the On-Demand Instance.

Additionally, if you attempt to add another rule with the non-canonical form of the CIDR (such as 100.68.0.18/18) and there is already a rule for the canonicalized form of the CIDR block (such as 100.68.0.0/18), the API throws an duplicate rule error.</p> </note> <p>When you modify a rule, you cannot change the rule type.
