<a href="https://ghost.org/"><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/120485/66918181-f88fdc80-f048-11e9-8135-d9c0e7b35ebc.png" alt="Fiercely independent, professional publishing.

The easiest way to get a production instance deployed is with our official **[Ghost(Pro)](https://ghost.org/pricing/)** managed service. It takes about 2 minutes to launch a new site with worldwide CDN, backups, security and maintenance all done for you.

For most people this ends up being the best value option cause of [how much time it saves](https://ghost.org/docs/hosting/) — and 100% of revenue goes to the Ghost Foundation; funding the maintenance and further development of the project itself. So you’ll be supporting open source software *and* getting a great service!

If you prefer to run on your own infrastructure, we also offer official 1-off installs and managed support and maintenance plans via **[Ghost(Valet)](https://valet.ghost.org)** - which can save a substantial amount of developer time and resources.

# Quickstart Install

If you want to run your own instance of Ghost, in most cases the best way is to use our **CLI tool**

```
npm install ghost-cli -g
```

&nbsp;

Then, if installing locally add the `local` flag to get up and running in under a minute - [Local install docs](https://ghost.org/docs/install/local/)

```
ghost install local
```

&nbsp;

or on a server run the full install, including automatic SSL setup using LetsEncrypt - [Production install docs](https://ghost.org/docs/install/ubuntu/)

```
ghost install
```

&nbsp;

Check out our [official documentation](https://ghost.org/docs/) for more information about our [recommended hosting stack](https://ghost.org/docs/hosting/) & properly [upgrading Ghost](https://ghost.org/docs/update/), plus everything you need to develop your own Ghost [themes](https://ghost.org/docs/themes/) or work with [our API](https://ghost.org/docs/content-api/).
