The easiest way to deploy Ghost is with our official **[Ghost(Pro)](https://ghost.org/pricing/)** managed service. You can have a fresh instance up and running in a couple of clicks with a worldwide CDN, backups, security and maintenance all done for you.

Not only will it save you hours of maintenance per month, but all revenue goes to the Ghost Foundation, which funds the maintenance and further development of Ghost itself. So you’ll be supporting open source software *and* getting a great service! Alternatively if you'd like to support us, we're very grateful to all our [GitHub Sponsors](https://github.com/sponsors/TryGhost) :heart:

If you prefer to run on your own infrastructure, we also provide 1-off installs and managed support and maintenance plans via **[Ghost(Valet)](https://valet.ghost.org)** - which can save a substantial amount of developer time and resources.

# Quickstart Install

If you want to run your own instance of Ghost, in most cases the best way is to use our **CLI tool**

```
$ npm install ghost-cli -g
```

&nbsp;

Then, if installing locally add the `local` flag to get up and running in under a minute - [Local install docs](https://ghost.org/docs/install/local/)

```
$ ghost install local
```

&nbsp;

or on a server run the full install, including automatic SSL setup using LetsEncrypt - [Production install docs](https://ghost.org/docs/install/ubuntu/)

```
$ ghost install
```

&nbsp;

Check out our [official documentation](https://ghost.org/docs/) for more information about our [recommended hosting stack](https://ghost.org/docs/concepts/hosting/) & properly [upgrading Ghost](https://ghost.org/faq/upgrade-to-ghost-2-0/), plus everything you need to develop your own Ghost [themes](https://ghost.org/docs/api/handlebars-themes/) or work with [our API](https://ghost.org/docs/api/).
