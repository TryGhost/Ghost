The project is maintained by a non-profit organisation called the **Ghost Foundation**, along with an amazing group of independent [contributors](https://github.com/TryGhost/Ghost/contributors). We're trying to make publishing software that changes the shape of online journalism.

# Deploying Ghost

![Ghost(Pro) + DigitalOcean](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/120485/8180331/d6674e32-1414-11e5-8ce4-2250e9994906.png)

Save yourself time and headaches with our fully managed **[Ghost(Pro)](https://ghost.org/pricing/)** service. Deploy a new instance of Ghost in a couple of clicks running on [DigitalOcean](https://digitalocean.com)’s rock solid infrastructure, with a worldwide CDN thrown in at no extra charge.

All revenue from **Ghost(Pro)** goes to the Ghost Foundation, the non-profit org which funds the maintenance and further development of Ghost.

[Other options](http://support.ghost.org/deploying-ghost/) are also available if you prefer playing around with servers by yourself.


# Staying Up to Date

When a new version of Ghost comes out, you'll want to look over these [upgrade instructions](http://support.ghost.org/how-to-upgrade/) for what to do next.

You can talk to other Ghost users and developers in our [public Slack team](https://ghost.org/slack/) (it's pretty awesome). We have a public meeting every Tuesday at 5:30pm UK time.

New releases are announced on the [dev blog](http://dev.ghost.org/tag/releases/). You can subscribe by email or follow [@TryGhost_Dev](https://twitter.com/tryghost_dev) on Twitter, if you prefer your updates bite-sized and facetious.
