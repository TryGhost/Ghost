# Shade

<p className="excerpt">**Shade** is Ghost's design system for product design. It contains all the necessary components and their usage that help you design a great product experience.</p>

## Stack

Shade uses the RadixUI based open source UI library, [ShadCN/UI](https://ui.shadcn.com/) as its foundation which does the heavy lifting and gives a great starting point for any UI component. Additionally Shade is built using [TailwindCSS](https://www.tailwindcss.com). Before diving deep into working with Shade, please get familiar with both of these libraries.

Shade uses [Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/) to document components and best practices.
