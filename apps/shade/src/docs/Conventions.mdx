## Composable vs. configurable components

In Shade we favor **composable** components over configurable ones. Read about the differences and the pros and cons for each in this [article](https://blog.tomaszgil.me/choosing-the-right-path-composable-vs-configurable-components-in-react).

## `className` prop

In order to make the design system flexible, all components in Shade should have a `className` prop that is applied to the rendered HTML component. The `className` should be merged with the default classes using the `cn` util, for example:

```
className={cn('bg-gray-200', className)}
```

Another example if variants are used:

```
className={cn(buttonVariants({variant, size, className}))}
```
