# Design Principles

<p className="excerpt">Our design principles guide every decision in Shade, from component design to interaction patterns. These principles help maintain consistency and quality across the system.</p>

## Core Principles

### 1. Composable Over Configurable

We favor **composable** components over configurable ones. This means:
- Components are built from smaller, focused pieces
- Flexibility through composition, not configuration
- Easier to maintain and extend
- More predictable behavior

Read more about this approach in this [article](https://blog.tomaszgil.me/choosing-the-right-path-composable-vs-configurable-components-in-react).

### 2. Consistent & Predictable
- Components behave consistently across surfaces
- Similar patterns use similar solutions
- Respect platform conventions

**Example**: Form controls maintain consistent spacing, validation, and error states.

### 3. Accessible by Default
- Meet WCAG 2.1 AA standards minimum
- Support keyboard navigation
- Maintain sufficient color contrast (4.5:1 for text)
- Proper ARIA attributes

### 4. Performance First
- Minimize bundle size
- Lazy load where appropriate
- Optimize for runtime performance

## Accessibility Standards

### Visual Design
- Text contrast ratio ≥ 4.5:1 (Level AA)
- Interactive element contrast ≥ 3:1
- Support reduced motion preferences
- Maintain legible text at 200% zoom

### Interaction Design
- All functionality available via keyboard
- Focus indicators visible and high contrast
- Skip links for navigation
- No time limits for interactions

### Content Structure
- Clear heading hierarchy
- Meaningful sequence in code
- Proper landmark regions
- Descriptive labels and instructions

## Content Guidelines

### Voice & Tone
- Clear and direct
- Professional but approachable
- Consistent across interfaces
- Action-oriented

### Writing Style
- Use sentence case for labels and headings
- Keep button text concise and action-focused
- Write descriptive error messages
- Use consistent terminology

### Examples

✅ Good:
- "Save changes"
- "Choose a date"
- "Invalid email address. Please check and try again."

❌ Avoid:
- "SUBMIT"
- "Click here"
- "Error occurred"

## Implementation Checklist

When implementing new components:

- [ ] Follows composable pattern
- [ ] Includes `className` prop with `cn` util
- [ ] Passes accessibility requirements
- [ ] Has proper test coverage
- [ ] Includes documentation
- [ ] Follows file structure conventions
