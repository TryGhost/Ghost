# Icons

In Shade we use Streamline icons. They are dynamically loaded from the `src/assets/icons` library, so to add a new icon you just need to create the corresponding SVG for it in this folder. Then you can use the Icon component like this:

```
<Icon.IconName size="md" />
```

If you check out the "Icons" component here in Storybook, you'll see a grid of all available icons in Shade. This list is dynamically loaded and if you click on an icon then the component code will be copied to your clipboard.

We need to make sure we stay consistent when **adding new icons**, so here are some rules to follow when doing so:

- Copy icons from the [Streamline Ultimate Regular collection](https://www.streamlinehq.com/icons/streamline-regular)
- The SVG properties should be
  - Size: 24px
  - Stroke width: 1.5px
  - Outline stroke: OFF
  - Responsive size: OFF
  - Currentcolor: ON
