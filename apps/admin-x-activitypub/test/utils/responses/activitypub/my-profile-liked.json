The Q&amp;A.</p><p>Got questions about ActivityPub, the Fediverse, Ghost, pugs or anything in between? Drop a comment on this week's newsletter and we'll answer as many as we can in the next one. Or take a long nap. Hard to say. We're unpredictable.</p><p>Hope you have a great week!</p>",

While you're enjoying a well-earned weekend, you might as well kick back and enjoy some more delightful tales of decentralized decadence from your favorite neighborhood pugs.</p><p><a href=\"https://activitypub.ghost.org/warp-factor-5-mr-sulu/\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Last week</a>, we delivered <em>substantial</em> performance improvements for ActivityPub in Ghost thanks to our long but necessary campaign to architect a solid database for all our Fediverse work. This week, we shipped a new feature! Dreams do come true.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-image-card kg-width-wide\"><img src=\"https://activitypub.ghost.org/content/images/2025/03/-delete.webp\" class=\"kg-image\" alt=\"\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1121\" srcset=\"https://activitypub.ghost.org/content/images/size/w600/2025/03/-delete.webp 600w, https://activitypub.ghost.org/content/images/size/w1000/2025/03/-delete.webp 1000w, https://activitypub.ghost.org/content/images/size/w1600/2025/03/-delete.webp 1600w, https://activitypub.ghost.org/content/images/size/w2400/2025/03/-delete.webp 2400w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1200px) 1200px\"></figure><h2 id=\"whats-new-with-activitypub\">What's new with ActivityPub?</h2><p>Up until now it has been possible to publish new content into the Fediverse with Ghost, but.. um... it was sort of permanent. If you made a typo or just changed your mind about something, there was no way to delete.</p><p>This week, we fixed that! You can now delete posts via ActivityPub.</p><p>On the face of it, deleting a post sounds like a pretty unremarkable feature. If you can create a post, it follows that it should be straightforward to delete it â€“ but distributed systems make things a little more interesting than centralized ones.</p><p>In a regular application when you create something (most of the time) you're just adding a row to a database. When you delete it, you delete that row from the database. There's really not much to talk about. </p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-video-card kg-width-wide\" data-kg-thumbnail=\"https://activitypub.ghost.org/content/media/2025/03/ap-delete2-1_thumb.jpg\" data-kg-custom-thumbnail=\"\">\n            <div class=\"kg-video-container\">\n                <video src=\"https://activitypub.ghost.org/content/media/2025/03/ap-delete2-1.mp4\" poster=\"https://img.spacergif.org/v1/1584x1080/0a/spacer.png\" width=\"1584\" height=\"1080\" playsinline=\"\" preload=\"metadata\" style=\"background: transparent url('https://activitypub.ghost.org/content/media/2025/03/ap-delete2-1_thumb.jpg') 50% 50% / cover no-repeat;\"></video>\n                <div class=\"kg-video-overlay\">\n                    <button class=\"kg-video-large-play-icon\" aria-label=\"Play video\">\n                        <svg xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\">\n                            <path d=\"M23.14 10.608 2.253.164A1.559 1.559 0 0 0 0 1.557v20.887a1.558 1.558 0 0 0 2.253 1.392L23.14 13.393a1.557 1.557 0 0 0 0-2.785Z\"></path>\n                        </svg>\n                    </button>\n                </div>\n                <div class=\"kg-video-player-container\">\n                    <div class=\"kg-video-player\">\n                        <button class=\"kg-video-play-icon\" aria-label=\"Play video\">\n                            <svg xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\">\n                                <path d=\"M23.14 10.608 2.253.164A1.559 1.559 0 0 0 0 1.557v20.887a1.558 1.558 0 0 0 2.253 1.392L23.14 13.393a1.557 1.557 0 0 0 0-2.785Z\"></path>\n                            </svg>\n                        </button>\n                        <button class=\"kg-video-pause-icon kg-video-hide\" aria-label=\"Pause video\">\n                            <svg xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\">\n                                <rect x=\"3\" y=\"1\" width=\"7\" height=\"22\" rx=\"1.5\" ry=\"1.5\"></rect>\n                                <rect x=\"14\" y=\"1\" width=\"7\" height=\"22\" rx=\"1.5\" ry=\"1.5\"></rect>\n                            </svg>\n                        </button>\n                        <span class=\"kg-video-current-time\">0:00</span>\n                        <div class=\"kg-video-time\">\n                            /<span class=\"kg-video-duration\">0:13</span>\n                        </div>\n                        <input type=\"range\" class=\"kg-video-seek-slider\" max=\"100\" value=\"0\">\n                        <button class=\"kg-video-playback-rate\" aria-label=\"Adjust playback speed\">1Ã—</button>\n                        <button class=\"kg-video-unmute-icon\" aria-label=\"Unmute\">\n                            <svg xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\">\n                                <path d=\"M15.189 2.021a9.728 9.728 0 0 0-7.924 4.85.249.249 0 0 1-.221.133H5.25a3 3 0 0 0-3 3v2a3 3 0 0 0 3 3h1.794a.249.249 0 0 1 .221.133 9.73 9.73 0 0 0 7.924 4.85h.06a1 1 0 0 0 1-1V3.02a1 1 0 0 0-1.06-.998Z\"></path>\n                            </svg>\n                        </button>\n                        <button class=\"kg-video-mute-icon kg-video-hide\" aria-label=\"Mute\">\n                            <svg xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\">\n                                <path d=\"M16.177 4.3a.248.248 0 0 0 .073-.176v-1.1a1 1 0 0 0-1.061-1 9.728 9.728 0 0 0-7.924 4.85.249.249 0 0 1-.221.133H5.25a3 3 0 0 0-3 3v2a3 3 0 0 0 3 3h.114a.251.251 0 0 0 .177-.073ZM23.707 1.706A1 1 0 0 0 22.293.292l-22 22a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.414l.009.009a1 1 0 0 0 1.405-.009l6.63-6.631A.251.251 0 0 1 8.515 17a.245.245 0 0 1 .177.075 10.081 10.081 0 0 0 6.5 2.92 1 1 0 0 0 1.061-1V9.266a.247.247 0 0 1 .073-.176Z\"></path>\n                            </svg>\n                        </button>\n                        <input type=\"range\" class=\"kg-video-volume-slider\" max=\"100\" value=\"100\">\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n            \n        </figure><p>In a decentralized network, though, the question is: Which database?</p><p>When you publish a post via ActivityPub it doesn't just get stored in 1 database, it gets sent out to every follower you have, and the server of every single one of your followers stores that post in <em>their</em> database, too. If you want to delete a post, it has to be deleted in all those different places, too â€” and that doesn't just happen automatically.</p><p>This is a relatively novel concept which hasn't been a significant feature of past decentralized protocols. If you send an email to 10,000 people, you can delete it from your email app's sent messages folder, but you can't delete it from anyone else's inbox. It's just... <em>out there</em>.</p><p>In ActivityPub, though, it is possible. When you publish a post, you send out a <code>create</code> activity that instructs the servers of all the people who follow you to create a new post. Then, if you change your mind, you can also send out a <code>delete</code> activity which instructs all those same servers to delete a particular post. That's <em>outbound</em> delete activity.</p><p>You also need to be able to handle an <em>inbound</em> delete activity, when someone else on another server sends a <code>delete</code> that they'd like you to process, to remove something you previously received from them.</p><p>As of this week, Ghost can now handle both inbound and outbound deletes, so that they work properly across the whole Fediverse.</p><figure class=\"kg-card kg-video-card kg-width-wide\" data-kg-thumbnail=\"https://activitypub.ghost.org/content/media/2025/03/ap-delete1-2_thumb.jpg\" data-kg-custom-thumbnail=\"\">\n            <div class=\"kg-video-container\">\n                <video src=\"https://activitypub.ghost.org/content/media/2025/03/ap-delete1-2.mp4\" poster=\"https://img.spacergif.org/v1/1920x1080/0a/spacer.png\" width=\"1920\" height=\"1080\" playsinline=\"\" preload=\"metadata\" style=\"background: transparent url('https://activitypub.ghost.org/content/media/2025/03/ap-delete1-2_thumb.jpg') 50% 50% / cover no-repeat;\"></video>\n                <div class=\"kg-video-overlay\">\n                    <button class=\"kg-video-large-play-icon\" aria-label=\"Play video\">\n                        <svg xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\">\n                            <path d=\"M23.14 10.608 2.253.164A1.559 1.559 0 0 0 0 1.557v20.887a1.558 1.558 0 0 0 2.253 1.392L23.14 13.393a1.557 1.557 0 0 0 0-2.785Z\"></path>\n                        </svg>\n                    </button>\n                </div>\n                <div class=\"kg-video-player-container\">\n                    <div class=\"kg-video-player\">\n                        <button class=\"kg-video-play-icon\" aria-label=\"Play video\">\n                            <svg xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\">\n                                <path d=\"M23.14 10.608 2.253.164A1.559 1.559 0 0 0 0 1.557v20.887a1.558 1.558 0 0 0 2.253 1.392L23.14 13.393a1.557 1.557 0 0 0 0-2.785Z\"></path>\n                            </svg>\n                        </button>\n                        <button class=\"kg-video-pause-icon kg-video-hide\" aria-label=\"Pause video\">\n                            <svg xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\">\n                                <rect x=\"3\" y=\"1\" width=\"7\" height=\"22\" rx=\"1.5\" ry=\"1.5\"></rect>\n                                <rect x=\"14\" y=\"1\" width=\"7\" height=\"22\" rx=\"1.5\" ry=\"1.5\"></rect>\n                            </svg>\n                        </button>\n                        <span class=\"kg-video-current-time\">0:00</span>\n                        <div class=\"kg-video-time\">\n                            /<span class=\"kg-video-duration\">0:45</span>\n                        </div>\n                        <input type=\"range\" class=\"kg-video-seek-slider\" max=\"100\" value=\"0\">\n                        <button class=\"kg-video-playback-rate\" aria-label=\"Adjust playback speed\">1Ã—</button>\n                        <button class=\"kg-video-unmute-icon\" aria-label=\"Unmute\">\n                            <svg xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\">\n                                <path d=\"M15.189 2.021a9.728 9.728 0 0 0-7.924 4.85.249.249 0 0 1-.221.133H5.25a3 3 0 0 0-3 3v2a3 3 0 0 0 3 3h1.794a.249.249 0 0 1 .221.133 9.73 9.73 0 0 0 7.924 4.85h.06a1 1 0 0 0 1-1V3.02a1 1 0 0 0-1.06-.998Z\"></path>\n                            </svg>\n                        </button>\n                        <button class=\"kg-video-mute-icon kg-video-hide\" aria-label=\"Mute\">\n                            <svg xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\">\n                                <path d=\"M16.177 4.3a.248.248 0 0 0 .073-.176v-1.1a1 1 0 0 0-1.061-1 9.728 9.728 0 0 0-7.924 4.85.249.249 0 0 1-.221.133H5.25a3 3 0 0 0-3 3v2a3 3 0 0 0 3 3h.114a.251.251 0 0 0 .177-.073ZM23.707 1.706A1 1 0 0 0 22.293.292l-22 22a1 1 0 0 0 0 1.414l.009.009a1 1 0 0 0 1.405-.009l6.63-6.631A.251.251 0 0 1 8.515 17a.245.245 0 0 1 .177.075 10.081 10.081 0 0 0 6.5 2.92 1 1 0 0 0 1.061-1V9.266a.247.247 0 0 1 .073-.176Z\"></path>\n                            </svg>\n                        </button>\n                        <input type=\"range\" class=\"kg-video-volume-slider\" max=\"100\" value=\"100\">\n                    </div>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n            \n        </figure><p>Once you wrap your head around the core idea that everything in ActivityPub is an <em>activity</em> which you send and receive, you begin to see how it's quite an elegant system for achieving a diverse set of functionality distributed across different applications. </p><p>It's a different way of thinking about building software.
