# Comments UI

Comments widget that is embedded at the bottom of posts in Ghost.

## Development

### Pre-requisites

- Run `yarn` in Ghost monorepo root

### Running via Ghost `yarn dev` in root folder

You can automatically start the comments dev server when developing Ghost by running Ghost (in root folder) via `yarn dev --all` or `yarn dev --comments`. This will host the comments JavaScript files, and makes sure that Ghost uses these locally hosted assets instead of the ones from the CDN.
