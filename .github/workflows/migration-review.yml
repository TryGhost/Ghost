            It looks like this PR contains a migration 👀
            Here's the checklist for reviewing migrations:

            ### General requirements

            - [ ]  Satisfies idempotency requirement (both `up()` and `down()`)
            - [ ]  Does not reference models
            - [ ]  Filename is in the correct format
            - [ ]  Targets the next minor version
            - [ ]  All code paths have appropriate log messages
            - [ ]  Uses the correct utils
            - [ ]  Contains a minimal changeset
            - [ ]  Does not mix DDL/DML operations

            ### Schema changes

            - [ ]  Both schema change and related migration have been implemented
            - [ ]  For index changes: has been performance tested for large tables
            - [ ]  For new tables/columns: fields use the appropriate predefined field lengths
            - [ ]  For new tables/columns: field names follow the appropriate conventions
            - [ ]  Does not drop a non-alpha table outside of a major version

            ### Data changes

            - [ ]  Mass updates/inserts are batched appropriately
            - [ ]  Does not loop over large tables/datasets
            - [ ]  Defends against missing or invalid data
            - [ ]  For settings updates: follows the appropriate guidelines
