# Tinybird

This folder contains configuration for Tinybird, so that the stats feature can be used.

We sync this configuration with Tinybird via the Tinybird CLI.

## Tinybird CLI

The Tinybird CLI is used via Docker.

```bash
yarn tb
```

Documentation for the Tinybird CLI: https://docs.tinybird.co/v/0.22.0/cli/overview
Note: you can use python if you prefer, but we use Docker for consistency.
