# Better Auth

Staff authentication on [Better Auth](https://www.better-auth.com), behind the
`auth:engine` config key. See the
[migration plan](../../../../../docs/plans/better-auth-migration.md)
for the design. Only the credential seeder below runs at boot.

- `knex-adapter.ts`: a Better Auth database adapter over a Knex instance. It
  imports nothing from Ghost, so it can become a package later. Ghost
  migrations own the DDL, so there is no `createSchema`.
- `ghost-models.ts`: maps Better Auth's `user`, `session`, `account` and
  `verification` models onto `users`, `user_sessions`, `user_accounts` and
  `verifications`, plus the `users` gaps described below.
- `seed-credential-accounts.ts`: gives each user a `credential` row in
  `user_accounts` with the hash from `users.password` (plan §4.4). Boot runs
  it wherever the in-development tables are created (development and testing
  with `createInDevelopmentTables`); it skips users that already have one.

## Tables

`user_accounts`, `user_sessions` and `verifications` are defined in
`schema.js` and listed in `IN_DEVELOPMENT_TABLES`, so they exist only in
development and testing databases and have no migration yet. Their dates are
`DATETIME(3)` (the `precision` column option), because Better Auth expects
dates to round-trip with their milliseconds.

## Columns `users` does not have

Better Auth's `user` model expects `emailVerified` (and `twoFactorEnabled`
with the `twoFactor` plugin), which `users` does not store. Rather than alter
`users` (plan §4.3), the adapter's `virtualColumns` option serves them as SQL
expressions: reads, filters and sorts use the expression, and writes to them
are dropped. `email_verified` is always `1`. That is not proof of the address
(the owner's email at setup is never verified), so no enabled flow may trust
it; plan §4.3 covers when that changes. `two_factor_enabled` is whether the user has a
verified `user_two_factors` row, and only applies once the `twoFactor` plugin
adds the field. `user.fields` only renames Better Auth's core fields, so the
plugin needs `ghostTwoFactorSchema` passed as its `schema` option.

The reverse also holds: `users.slug` and `users.password` are `NOT NULL` and
Better Auth never sets them. The adapter's `createDefaults` option fills them
on insert: the slug is the id, and the password is `!`, which is never a valid
bcrypt hash, so the legacy check rejects it. Ghost disables Better Auth sign-up,
so this only matters once Better Auth provisions users (SSO, Phase 8).

## Adapter suite

`test/integration/auth/knex-adapter.test.ts` runs Better Auth's adapter suite
(`normal`, `joins`, `transactions`, `case-insensitive`, `auth-flow`) on MySQL
in two lanes, each in its own database:

- **better-auth tables**: every model in Better Auth's shape under Ghost's
  table and column names. Tests the adapter itself.
- **ghost users**: `users`, `user_accounts`, `user_sessions` and
  `verifications` built from `schema.js` with `commands.createTable`, so their
  real types, lengths, indexes and foreign keys are tested, with the virtual
  columns and create defaults. Models the suite renames or tables `schema.js`
  does not define fall back to Better Auth's shape, and `users.id` foreign
  keys follow a renamed user table.

`numberIdTestSuite` and `uuidTestSuite` are not run: Ghost ids are ObjectIds.

Last run (Better Auth 1.7.15, MySQL 8): 480 tests, 465 pass, 15 skipped, 0
fail. Each skip is a test that cannot pass against Ghost's schema. None comes
from the three new tables: their millisecond dates round-trip, and their
foreign keys and `NOT NULL` columns hold for every test.

The virtual columns cost only the tests that store `emailVerified: false`, so
plan §10 open decision 1 does not need real columns on these grounds.
