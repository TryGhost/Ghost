Vibrant colors with a darker hue\ntend to work best, as a general rule.\n\nInstalling Ghost themes\nBy default, new sites are created with Ghost's friendly publication theme,\ncalled Casper. Everything in Casper is optimized to work for the most common\ntypes of blog, newsletter and publication that people create with Ghost — so\nit's a perfect place to start.\n\nHowever, there are hundreds of different themes available to install, so you can\npick out a look and feel that suits you best.\n\nGhost Admin → Settings → ThemeInside Ghost's theme settings you'll find 4 more\nofficial themes that can be directly installed and activated. Each theme is\nsuited to slightly different use-cases.\n\n * Casper (default) — Made for all sorts of blogs and newsletters\n * Edition — A beautiful minimal template for newsletter authors\n * Alto — A slick news/magazine style design for creators\n * London — A light photography theme with a bold grid\n * Ease — A library theme for organizing large content archives\n\nAnd if none of those feel quite right, head on over to the Ghost Marketplace\n[https://ghost.org/themes/], where you'll find a huge variety of both free and\npremium themes.\n\nBuilding something custom\nFinally, if you want something completely bespoke for your site, you can always\nbuild a custom theme from scratch and upload it to your site.\n\nGhost's theming template files are very easy to work with, and can be picked up\nin the space of a few hours by anyone who has just a little bit of knowledge of\nHTML and CSS. Templates from other platforms can also be ported to Ghost with\nrelatively little effort.\n\nIf you want to take a quick look at the theme syntax to see what it's like, you\ncan browse through the files of the default Casper theme\n[https://github.com/tryghost/casper/]. We've added tons of inline code comments\nto make it easy to learn, and the structure is very readable.\n\n{{#post}}\n<article class=\"article {{post_class}}\">\n\n    <h1>{{title}}</h1>\n    \n    {{#if feature_image}}\n    \t<img src=\"{{feature_image}}\" alt=\"Feature image\" />\n    {{/if}}\n    \n    {{content}}\n\n</article>\n{{/post}}\n\nA snippet from a post templateSee?
