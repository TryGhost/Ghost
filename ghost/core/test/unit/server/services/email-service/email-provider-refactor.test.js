/**
 * Email Provider Refactor Test
 *
 * This test documents that PR #25244 is a pure refactor that extracts
 * email provider creation to a private method without changing behavior.
 *
 * The refactor moves provider instantiation from init() to #createEmailProvider()
 * for better code organization and to prepare for multiple provider support.
 *
 * Behavior verification:
 * - All 296 existing email service tests continue to pass
 * - No functional changes were made
 * - The refactor is purely organizational
